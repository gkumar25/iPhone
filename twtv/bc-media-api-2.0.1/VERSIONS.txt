#2.0.1

 New:
  - Compatible with the latest iOS 4.2 SDK from Apple.
  - BCMediaDeliveryTypeHTTP_IOS added to support the new http
    streaming transcode settings.
 Changes:
  - BCMediaDeliveryTypeHTTP is now the default media delivery type
 
#2.0.0

 Changes:
  - Logging property has moved to the BCConfigManager class from
    the BCMediaAPI class. The logging output is the same, the flag
    has just moved.
  - SBJSON header files are now public and available in the same
    header search path as our media API headers.

#1.2.2

 Changes:
  - Switch from double to long long. Some of our Media API methods
    and properties for some of our model objects used double as their
    type. These have now been replaced with a long long type. This 
    better reflects the values returned by the Media APIs as we don't 
    have floating point values for our ids.
  - Region support has been moved to it's own class. The
    BCConfigManager class now manages the region for all libraries
    from Brightcove. In this library, libBrightcoveMediaAPI.a, the 
    endpoint api.brightcove.com or api.brightcove.co.jp is applied.

#1.2.1

 New:
  - Region support, you can now specify what end point you
    want to make your API calls to, api.brightcove.com or
    api.brightcove.co.jp.
  - udsSupportOn property has been changed to mediaDeliveryType.
    This property takes a BCMediaDeliveryType enum value, 
    BCMediaDeliveryTypeDefault or BCMediaDeliveryTypeHTTP. The
    default value is BCMediaDeliveryTypeDefault which will use
    the default media delivery type for your account. If your 
    app was using the udsSupportOn property to force http media 
    urls use the BCMediaDeliveryTypeHTTP enum value.
  - Logging, by setting the logging property to true
    on the BCMediaAPI class you can see the contents of your
    calls to api.brightcove.(com/co.jp) and the returned data. 
    Turn this off in your release builds.
  - Compatible with the latest iOS 4.0 SDK from Apple.

    Desktop Cocoa applications.
